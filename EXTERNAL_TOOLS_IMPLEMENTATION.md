# External Tools Implementation

## Overview

This implementation replaces the previous "agent" functionality with a more robust external tools system. The AI is now aware of external tools it can access and will inform users about these capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Agent Functionality
- Deleted `agent_service.dart` and `agent_widget.dart`
- Removed agent mode toggle and UI components
- Removed agent-specific processing logic from chat flow

### 2. Added External Tools Service (`external_tools_service.dart`)

The new `ExternalToolsService` provides:

#### Available Tools:
- **Screenshot Tool**: Captures screenshots of any webpage
- **AI Models Fetcher**: Dynamically fetches available AI models from API
- **Model Switcher**: Switches to different AI models when current one isn't performing well
- **Web Search**: Searches Wikipedia and other sources for current information

#### Key Features:
- Each tool has clear description and parameters
- Tools are executed on-demand based on user requests
- AI is informed about tool availability through system prompt
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. Updated AI Awareness

The AI now receives a system prompt that includes:
- Information about all available external tools
- Instructions on when and how to mention tool capabilities
- Guidance on being helpful about tool features

Example system prompt excerpt:
```
You are AhamAI, an intelligent assistant with access to external tools.

Available External Tools:
- screenshot: Takes a screenshot of any webpage. The AI can use this tool to visually understand websites, capture content, or help users with visual tasks.
- fetch_ai_models: Fetches available AI models from the API. The AI can use this to switch models if one is not responding or if the user is not satisfied with the current model.
- web_search: Searches the web for current information. The AI can use this to get up-to-date information about any topic.

When a user asks for something that requires external tools, you should:
1. Acknowledge that you have the capability
2. Explain what tool you would use
3. Inform the user that you can access these tools on demand
4. Provide helpful information about what the tool can do
```

### 4. UI Updates

#### Input Bar Changes:
- Replaced "Agent Mode" toggle with "Tools" indicator
- Shows when external tools are executing
- Updated hint text to mention external tools availability

#### Status Indicators:
- Removed agent processing panel
- Added simple external tools execution indicator
- Shows current tool being used

#### Tools Button:
- Clicking shows available tools information
- Always active to indicate tools are available
- Uses tools icon instead of brain icon

## How It Works

### For Users:
1. **Natural Interaction**: Users can ask for screenshots, model switching, or web searches naturally
2. **AI Awareness**: The AI will mention when it can use external tools to help
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators when tools are being used
4. **Tool Information**: Click the tools button to see available capabilities

### For AI:
1. **Tool Awareness**: AI knows what external tools are available
2. **Contextual Usage**: AI can mention tools when relevant to user requests
3. **Capability Communication**: AI explains tool capabilities to users
4. **Seamless Integration**: Tools work behind the scenes when needed

### Example Interactions:

**User**: "Can you take a screenshot of google.com?"
**AI**: "I can definitely help you with that! I have access to a screenshot tool that can capture any webpage visually. Let me take a screenshot of google.com for you..."

**User**: "This model isn't giving good responses"
**AI**: "I understand your concern. I have access to a model switching tool that can fetch available AI models and switch to a different one. Let me check what other models are available and suggest alternatives..."

**User**: "What's the latest news about AI?"
**AI**: "I can search the web for current information about AI using my web search tool. Let me find the latest news and information for you..."

## Technical Implementation

### External Tools Service
- Singleton pattern for global access
- Async tool execution with proper error handling
- Tool status tracking and notifications
- Comprehensive tool documentation

### Tool Integration
- Tools are called based on user requests
- Results are incorporated into AI responses
- Progress indicators during tool execution
- Clear success/failure messaging

### Model Integration
- System prompt includes tool information
- AI trained to mention tool capabilities
- Natural conversation flow maintained
- Tool usage is context-aware

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users know what the AI can do beyond just chatting
2. **Transparent Capabilities**: Clear communication about available tools
3. **Flexible Architecture**: Easy to add new tools in the future
4. **Natural Interaction**: Tools are mentioned naturally in conversation
5. **Reliable Execution**: Robust error handling and user feedback
6. **Model Switching**: AI can switch models when performance is poor

## Future Enhancements

- Add more external tools (file handling, calculations, etc.)
- Implement tool chaining for complex tasks
- Add user preferences for tool usage
- Enhance tool result visualization
- Add tool usage analytics
